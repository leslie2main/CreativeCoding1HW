When I took the Learning Style Quiz and saw the results of “how I learned best,” I was in total agreeance. I am a Tactical and Visual learner which basically means I learn best when things are hands on and in a visual form. The agreeance is based on how successful I was with learning from situations or problems in the past. I have been a student-athlete my whole life with great accomplishments endured during that time period. Being an athlete, everything was hands on and visual, I learned great and even flourished in that environment. Yet, after reading, “The Problem with Learning Styles,” I realized that it is only a mindset. “I am only good at this,” and “I don’t thrive in this,” well… being a Tactical and Visual learner is only one part of me. If anything I feel as though I also thrive in environments where I can learn on my own rather than having a teacher visualize things for me. In my whole academic career, online classes have been environments where I succeed the best. So, what I have learned is that being open minded about my attributes and my abilities will only help me strive even further in becoming successful.
