“Echoes of Light” is a 2D minimalist puzzle game where the player controls a small beam of light navigating through a dark, shifting world. The goal is to solve environmental puzzles by manipulating mirrors, shadows, and light-based mechanics to unlock the path forward. Each level is a contained puzzle room, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity.

The game is inspired by my artistic interest in light, contrast, and simple elegant game design. It is similar to games like Limbo or Monument Valley, but in a stripped-down aesthetic using p5.js.

“Echoes of Light” is my attempt to blend artistry and interactivity through a game that’s both meditative and mentally engaging. It encourages players to think differently, observe carefully, and find beauty in simplicity.
